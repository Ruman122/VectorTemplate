# VectorTemplate
this rep stores vector template in C++ (kind of vector template). It is just the 1st version of that but I'm glad that it is work !

To use it :
0) Add the header fije to your pproject or folder (depends on what you are using), include the file to the your main file : #include "vectemp.h"
1) Make an object of this template class : VecTemp<YOUR DATATYPE> your_obj(size_of_your_vector_template); - size is important!
Now the methods:
1) .push(value) - push the value to your vector template , if the vector is full you'll get the message about it.
2) .see_size() - to check the size of the vector.
3) .is_empty() - to check if the vector empty. Returns true or false .
That's all for now .
